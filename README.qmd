The goal of `layer` is to simplify the whole process of creating stacked tilted maps, that are often used in scientific publications to show different environmental
layers for a geographical region. Tilting maps and layering them allows to easily draw visual correlations between these environmental layers.

Something in the line of:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "Example of a stacked tilted map by CÃ©dric Scherer and Marco Sciaini"}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/example.jpg_large")
```

## Installation

You can install the development version of layer from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("marcosci/layer")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, fig.alt = "Basic example of a stacked tilted map"}
library(layer)

tilt_landscape_1 <- tilt_map(landscape_1)
tilt_landscape_2 <- tilt_map(landscape_2, x_shift = 25, y_shift = 50)
tilt_landscape_3 <- tilt_map(landscape_3, x_shift = 50, y_shift = 100)
tilt_landscape_points <- tilt_map(landscape_points, x_shift = 75, y_shift = 150)

map_list <- list(tilt_landscape_1, tilt_landscape_2, tilt_landscape_3, tilt_landscape_points)

plot_tiltedmaps(map_list,
                layer = c("value", "value", "value", NA),
                palette = c("bilbao", "mako", "rocket", NA),
                color = "grey40")
```

### More advanced example

Some more realistic looking data (DEM, drought, precipitation, and wildfires for continental USA): 

```{r adv-example, eval = !file.exists("man/figures/README-adv-example.png"), fig.alt = "Advanced example of a stacked tilted map"}
tilt_landscape_1 <- tilt_map(dem_usa, y_tilt = 3)
tilt_landscape_2 <- tilt_map(drought_usa, y_tilt = 3, x_shift = 15, y_shift = 25)
tilt_landscape_3 <- tilt_map(prec_usa, y_tilt = 3, x_shift = 30, y_shift = 50)
tilt_landscape_4 <- tilt_map(fire_usa, y_tilt = 3, x_shift = 45, y_shift = 65)

map_list <- list(tilt_landscape_1, tilt_landscape_2, tilt_landscape_3, tilt_landscape_4)

plot_tiltedmaps(map_list, palette = c("tofino", "rocket", "mako", "magma"), direction = c(-1, 1, 1, 1))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "Advanced example of a stacked tilted map"}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/README-adv-example.png")
```
